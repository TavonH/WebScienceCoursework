The tweets_sample.json file is the data obtained by crawling from Twitter by running the DataCrawling.py file; the sample_DataProcessing_res.zip file stores the results after running DataProcessing.py, and the data for each type of emotion is stored in a separate csv file.


The actual data analyzed by this coursework is tweets.json. The analysis results and crowdsourcing results are stored in the DataProcessing & Crowdsourcing_res.zip file.
